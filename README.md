# djangoTest

This is a github repo for test and learning Django Framework.
Maybe it can help you quick understand what django is.

All of these examples can be run directly if you computers' enviroment meets.(at least I tryed windows 8.1 and Centos 7)

Here is my development enviroment:

- Django version : 1.8.1
- Python version : 2.7.5
- OS System: centos 7

Hope you have fun! Any pull request is welcome.
